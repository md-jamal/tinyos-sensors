---> It is a 128K*8(1024K Bit) Serial EEPROM,
Address Range: 00000 --- 1FFFF
B0=0	->	00000	---->	0FFFF
B0=1 	->	10000	---->	1FFFF

---> The device supports both page write upto 128 bytes at a time and byte write

---> Device capable of  both random and sequential reads

---> A0,A1 inputs are used by the EEPROM for multiple device operations.Up to four devices may be connected to the same bus by using different chip select bit combinations.

---> I2C: MSP430(Master),EEPROM(Slave)

---> Control Byte is the first byte received following the start condition.It consists of a 4-bit Control code(1010) .The next bit is the Block Select Bit(B0),
This bit acts as the A16 address bit for accessing the entire array.Then A0,A1.Then last bit will contain whether it is write(0) or read(1)

---> The next two bytes received define the address of the first data byte.The upper address bits are transferred first,followed by the Less significant bits.


---> The device has an internal addressing boundary limitation that is divided into two segments of 512k Bits.Block select Bit(B0) to control access each segment.

---> Control Byte + Address High Byte + Address Low Byte

---> Byte Write:

	---> Control Byte + Higher Order Byte of the Word Address + Lower Order Byte of the Word Address + Data Transmission


---> Page Write:

	---> Control Byte + Higher Order Byte of the Word Address + Lower Order Byte of the Word Address + Data Byte 

	But instead of generating a stop Condition ,the master transmits up to 127 additional 









---> Read Operation :

	R/W bit of the control byte is set to One.There are three basic types:Current read,random read and sequential read.	


Random Read: Start + Control Byte(W) + Higher 8 bit of Word Address + Lower 8 bit of Word Address + Start + Control Byte(R) + Read 1 Byte + Stop
